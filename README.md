This is a recreation of Wealth and Health of Nations bubble chart in <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> of Gapminder’s <a href="http://gapminder.org/world/">Wealth & Health of Nations</a>, made famous by Hans Rosling’s memorable <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html">2006 TED talk</a>. 

Build by <a href="http://www.cacheflow.ca/">Derek Braid</a> with code from Mike Bostock (d3js.org) using d3, lodash, queue.js, angular-ui. 

Studies GDP, Employment and Per Capita Income from 1987-2018(est) for the largest 28 cities in Canada.  Data from Conference Board of Canada.  


<p>As <a href="http://randometc.github.com/mind-gapper-js/">Tom Carden</a> noted, there’s a surprising amount of work that goes into making something look simple. 

In this case over 12000 data points were required to get the desired breadth (over 30 years of quarterly data in 3 distinct metrics). 

These visualizations use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lerp_(computing)">linear interpolation</a> for missing data points (thanks d3js & Mike Bostock). The lookup for the two interpolation values at each frame is accelerated using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">bisection</a> of sorted arrays per dimension.
